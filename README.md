The study introduces a **stabilizer factor**, a new metric designed to assess the quality of data anonymization in federated cloud environments. It measures how evenly data values are distributed across categories, providing insight into the regularity and anonymization level of the dataset.

## Key Findings
- **Equitable distribution:** When all categories have the same frequency, the stabilizer factor decreases as the number of categories increases.  
- **Non-equitable distribution:** When category frequencies differ, the factor still decreases with more categories, highlighting sensitivity to uneven distributions.  

The stabilizer factor therefore serves as a quantitative tool for evaluating anonymization quality and the effect of categorical granularity in datasets.
