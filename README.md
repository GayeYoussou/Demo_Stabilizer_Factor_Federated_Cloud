It presents the **mathematical demonstration of the Stabilizer Factor**.
The Stabilizer Factor, denoted as *\(P\)*, **adjusts the Shannon index to distinguish between identifiers and evenly distributed categories**, providing a rigorous and robust evaluation of anonymization quality in categorical datasets. 

---

**Definition.** Let *p* be the relative frequency that represents the probability that a value is in category *C(i)*. The stabilizer factor P is defined as follows:

\[
P = \prod_{i=1}^{S} p(x = C(i)) \quad \text{with} \quad p(x = C(i)) = \frac{n_i}{N}, \quad \sum_{i=1}^{S} n_i = N
\]

Where:  
- *S* is the total number of categories for the attribute,  
- *n_i* is the count of entries in category *\(C(i)\)*,  
- *N* is the total number of entries.

## ðŸ”¬ Demonstration Cases

### Case 1: Equitable Distribution
- All categories have **equal frequency** (\(n_1 = n_2 = ... = n_S = a\)).
- **Lemma:** For two equitable distributions of the same attribute with \(S_1 < S_2\) categories:

\[
P_1 > P_2
\]

- **Conclusion:** Increasing the number of equally distributed categories **decreases \(P\)**, reflecting a lower level of anonymity.

### Case 2: Non-Equitable Distribution
- Categories have **unequal frequencies**.
- **Lemma:** For two non-equitable distributions of the same attribute with \(S_1 < S_2\) categories:

\[
P_1 > P_2
\]

- **Proof Approach:**
  1. Use recurrence on the number of categories \(k\).  
  2. Compare the product of relative frequencies for sequences of length \(k\) and \(k+1\).  
  3. Show that \(P\) strictly decreases as categories are added or redistributed, regardless of frequency skew.

- **Conclusion:** Even with non-uniform distributions, increasing the number of categories or skewing the frequency distribution reduces \(P\), confirming the factorâ€™s sensitivity to attribute granularity.

---

## Key Findings
- **Equitable distribution:** When all categories have the same frequency, the stabilizer factor decreases as the number of categories increases.  
- **Non-equitable distribution:** When category frequencies differ, the factor still decreases with more categories, highlighting sensitivity to uneven distributions.
